> Simplicity beats complexity

We do this is through simple data solutions that enable organisations to grow. 

**Keeping data simple**

We love working with data because we’ve seen first-hand how it can transform organisations. But only when the time from raising a question to obtaining the answer is ***quick*** and the findings ***reliable***.

Data stacks and solutions can quickly become over-complicated and time-consuming. Processing trillions of rows of data isn’t the way to find an answer quickly. Our principle of keeping things simple and efficient guards against this. Hence our mantra:

> Build the data solution you need *today*, not the one you *might* need in two years’ time.

Keeping things simple doesn’t mean you’re compromising on quality, far from it. Simplicity in this scenario means having precisely the data you need, when you need it, how you need it, to become a successful data-driven business. 

To achieve this, you need a data stack that enables quick and easy Data Science, Data Engineering and Data Analytics iterative improvements. This in turn encourages the different areas of your data team to understand each other’s processes, improving the overall efficiency in finding the data you need.

## How we help

We can set up, refine and rebuild your data stack to ensure your organisation can efficiently fulfil the range of data tasks it’s likely to encounter, now and in the future. 

### A start-up or scaling company with no data stack

You need a data stack that supports not hinders your business, and can flex as you need it to take your business forwards. We can set this up for you.  

When we’ve built your data stack, any curious Analyst or Scientist will be able to learn the engineering side of data management, enabling the discovery of new data sources that can be made available for analysis, and unlocking powerful analytics for your organisation.

Ultimately, this will allow your data team to provide answers quickly, receive feedback and iterate without an engineering bottleneck.

### Already have a data stack?

How’s it working for you? Is it quick, easy to use and giving you reliable data you can trust and use? If the answer to any of these is a no, we can review your current data stack and technologies, and recommend improvements. 

If you need a more extensive update or reconfiguration, we can guide you through the best solution for your organisation, implementing changes and resolving analytical issues along the way, to give you the efficient organisation-wide reporting you need. 

# Simple, reliable, transparent data solutions giving you data you can trust and understand. 

# It’s what every company needs, and what we deliver.
