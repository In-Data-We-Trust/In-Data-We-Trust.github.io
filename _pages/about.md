<!-- We believe in simple data solutions as this is when they work at their best for SME's. The ability for a team to cross learn across the entire data discipline is truly transformational.  -->

## Our Mission

**To help organisations ***trust*** their data, become data driven and use this to grow** üöÄ

Building new data stacks and solutions can easily become ***complicated*** and time consuming. We guard against this pitfall by having a principle of doing the exact opposite. 

> Simplicity beats complexity.

## How to Make Your Data Stack Help You?

Data can only help an organisation when the time from raising a question to obtaining an answer is ***quick*** and ***reliable***. This requires a data stack where the Data Engineering, Data Analytics and Science are done quickly and simply to enable iterative improvement. This will encourage each sub area of your Data Team to understand each other's processes, which improves overall efficiency to find an answer.

Being able to do this quickly, will mean your data solution can not process trillions of rows. Which leads us onto our next catchphrase:

> Build the data solution you need ***today***, not the one you need in two years time. 

Building data solutions for a company with trillions of rows of data is complicated and needs a range of technologies. These cost a lot of money to build and maintain. It does not let you quickly engineer and analyse. When a company has small data volumes, the speed at which person can Engineer and Analyse, is much more important. With speed you can begin to experiment and understand your product in more detail leading to better rewards and happier customers. This approach needs data to fuel which will drive your business to growth!

With larger companies, comes excessive amounts of data which need hyper efficient and therefore need a hyper complex solution to handle the data. With a smaller to medium sized company, this is not the case for which you don't need.

## How Can We Help You?

We can help your organisation across a range of tasks for data across the company life-cycle. 

### Start Up or Young Company with No Data-Stack

We have both an AWS stack and an Azure stack that we have used first-hand and recommend. It is a simple stack that is infinitely better than a complicated solution at this stage of the company. 

With our recommended data stacks, they will let any curious Analyst or Scientist learn the Engineering aspect of Data. This can begin to unlock powerful analytics for your organisation! They can discover a new data source, table or API, make the data available to themselves. Which allows them to provide an answer, receive feedback and iterate as required.

### We Already Have a Data-Stack

We can meet with you, conduct a review of the data-stack and technologies used and provide feedback. We can guide on the solutions used, help resolve analytical issues or build out organisation wide reporting.
