<!-- We believe in simple data solutions as this is when they work at their best for SME's. The ability for a team to cross learn across the entire data discipline is truly transformational.  -->

## Why Were We Founded?

To help organisations ***trust*** their data, become data driven and use this to grow üöÄ

Data stacks and solutions can easily become ***complicated*** and time consuming to build new data feeds. We guard against this pitfall by have a principle of doing the exact opposite. 

> Simplicity beats complexity.

## How to Make Your Data Stack Help You?

Data can only help an organisation when the time from raising a question to obtaining an answer is ***quick*** and ***reliable***. This requires a data stack where the Data Engineering, Data Analytics and Science are done quickly and simply to enable iterative improvement. This will encourage each sub area of you Data Team to understand the other's, which will improve overall efficiency to find an answer.

Being able to do this quickly, will mean your data solution can't process trillions of rows. Which leads us onto our next catchphrase:

> Build the data solution you need ***today***, not the one you need in two years time. 

Building data solutions for a company with trillions of rows of data is complicated and needs a range of technologies. These cost a lot of money to build and maintain. It doesn't let you quickly Engineer and Analyse. When a company has small data volumes, the speed at which it an Engineer and Analyse, is much more important. With speed you can begin to experiment and understand your product in more detail leading to better rewards and happier customers. This approach needs data to fuel it but will drive your business growth!

## How Can We Help You?

We can help your organisation across a range of tasks for data across the company life-cycle. 

### Start Up or Young Company with No Data-Stack

We have both an AWS stack and an Azure stack that we have used first-hand and recommend. It is a simple stack that is infinitely better than a complicated solution at this stage of the company. 

With our recommended data stacks, they will let any curious Analyst or Scientist learn the Engineering aspect of Data. This can begin to unlock some powerful analytics for your organisation! They can discover a new data source, table or API and make the data available to themselves. Provide an answer, receive feedback and iterate as required.

### We Already Have a Data-Stack

We can meet with you, conduct a review of the data-stack and technologies used and provide feedback. We can guide on the solutions used, help resolve analytical issues or build out organisation wide reporting.

## What Have We Learnt?

With over 10 years of working across the data space in numerous roles (Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Owner and Strategic adviser) there is a lot of information to share! 

The above is a summary of some our lessons learned and we are committed to posting our findings in more detail on our blog page.
