Having worked in a range of companies I want to share my findings, learnings and opinions about data stacks, with the hope that organisations can frame their discussions on focusing on why they are needed?

***To answer your questions which then drive decisions to generate Business Value!***

## How can I help you on your data journey?

I started my career as a Management Consultant and then moved to become a hands-on data driven individual where I have experience of working across the full spectrum of Data. From engineering pipelines, designing and modelling data warehouses and building organisational wide analytics

From my experience of working as a full stack data individual, I have learnt one key lesson. **Business Value should remain the *why* of any decision** when designing or building any data solution.

I want to provide companies a framework to use when thinking of the *why* or *so what* for any development or platform building data related.

At it's core an effective data solution provides information into the hands of people **quickly** to make decisions. The more complicated the data stack, the longer the time is to generate this value. Hence, simplicity is key for data solutions which I will breakdown over a series of posts.


> Why do you need an over complicated solution when the companies database can operate on a desktop computer? Do not let your organisations data solution be a learning ground for resources to learn the newest and trendiest technologies!!

Trust me, you do not want your huge cost to be used to provide resources a great learning opportunity and not much value to your organisation!

I have seen solutions built multiple times with exceedingly complexity that just weren't needed in relation to an organisations size. When this happens, design overkill has occurred and the original purpose was long forgotten.

## Do you have architectural overkill in your data stack that is killing time to generate value?

This is a difficult and challenging item to identify when reviewing documentation and ways of working. However in my career I have seen some tell-tale signs that point to the data solution being not focused on ***Business Value*** and being academic:

* The time to engineer data is long and complicated
* Data is engineered, the task is marked as complete and people do not have access to the data
* There are continuous issues with the stability of the data stack, errors, failed pipelines that are not resolved

***If any of the above sound like issues your company is facing, read the rest of this article could transform your company and how it uses data!***

## Types of Solutions and which one is needed?

Over my career I have seen two types of data solutions…

***Solution 1 - Built for scale where scale is needed***

Data Stack that is built to scale to be able to meet the demands of any volumes. It uses the best in class technologies with the latest tools

* Who needs this? - Companies that need real-time data at their fingertips for their customers. Think of Uber, Amazon, Airbnb etc (**i.e. very few**). Organisations data that can not be run on a desktop machine.
* Technologies used - A lot of them! Resources are needed that are unicorns, experienced and not cost effective
* Cost - Astronomical to build and not sustainable for small and medium businesses from both a resource and cloud cost perspective

***Solution 2 - Built for organisations that need speed of insights***

This is the most simple and elegant solutions that consist of 3 simple items:

1. Cloud-based data pipeline orchestration tool
2. Data Storage solution
3. Data Reporting and Access Solution

* Who needs this? - Majority of companies small and medium sized companies. Where time to an answer can make a huge impact on the companies growth. This is the optimum solution for any * company where their data can exist on a desktop machine
* Technologies Required: SQL, Python and how to use a cloud orchestration tool
* Cost - Affordable and easy to run 

## What do I need my data solution to do?

When deciding what solution is needed, we need to remind ourselves of generating business value first and foremost. The solution should fit the current size and volumes of the company.

***I have seen solution 1 used far too many times when it was not the right decision for the company.***

There are many industry terminologies for data and how it can be used with as many tools available. The list is endless and using the wrong one can cause huge challenges as your organisation depends more and more on the data stack. The art is stitching them together in a way that works reliably, is simple to engineer new data and has minimal cloud and people cost to operate. This harmony is when you are receiving value from your data

## How on Earth do I then get a data solution to work as intended?

There is a lot of information to unpick to enable an organisation to pick and choose a data solution that works for them. Along with healthy challenge on the journey towards building a data driven culture.

In my next article, I will provide break the problem into two parts:

1. How much will it cost to build the data solution? And then operate it with cloud infrastructure as well as resources that can understand the full stack?
2. How will the stack enable engineers and analysts to run at lightning speed?

With the above two areas to focus on, this will help you have discussions within your organisation to move data-stack building in the right direction!
