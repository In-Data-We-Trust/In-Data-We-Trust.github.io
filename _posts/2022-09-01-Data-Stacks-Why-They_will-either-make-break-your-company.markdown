Having worked in a range of companies from 20-person startups to large enterprises, I want to share my findings about data sacks. I have used those that will make your company flourish and those that will make your company fail!

## How Can I Help You on Your DataÂ Journey?

I have worked with data stacks that fuel organisations growth ðŸš€ and others that can grind it to a halt! â›”

There are some tell-tale signs that the current data setup is not working for your organisation. If the below sounds familiar, then you could have a stack that isn't helping you:

* The time to engineer data from a simple source is long and complicated
* Data is engineered, the task is marked as complete and people do not have access to the data
* There are continuous issues with the stability of the data stack, errors, failed pipelines that are not resolved
* The cost of the data stack is spiralling out of control as volumes increase

If any of the above sound familiar, I have some ideas that may help further on. 
<!-- Not sure if this needed - will review after -->

<!-- I started my career as a Management Consultant and then moved to become a hands-on data driven individual where I have experience of working across the full spectrum of Data. From engineering pipelines, designing and modelling data warehouses and building organisational wide analytics

From my experience of working as a full stack data individual, I have learnt one key lesson. **Business Value should remain the *why* of any decision** when designing or building any data solution.

I want to provide companies a framework to use when thinking of the *why* or *so what* for any development or platform building data related. -->

An effective data solution ***must*** provide information into the hands of people ***quickly*** to make decisions. The more complicated the data stack, the longer it takes to provide an answer to any question that's raised. Simplicity reduces the time to conclude end-to-end analytics and is key for a data solution to provide ***Business Value***. 

> You do not need a complicated solution when your companies database can operate on a desktop computer! 

<!-- Trust me, you do not want your huge cost to be used to provide resources a great learning opportunity and not much value to your organisation! -->

I have seen various organisations build complicated solutions. Which at the time were not required when compared against their data volumes and business maturity. This design overkill prevents the data stack providing the needed analytics at speed and makes it a hugely costly exercise. 

## What Solution Should You Use?

Over my career I have seen two types of data solutions. 

### Solution 1â€Š-â€ŠBuilt for Large Volumes of Real-Time Data Processing 

Data Stack that is built to scale to meet the demands of large data volumes with real-time data availability. It uses the best in class technologies with the latest tools.

* **Who needs this?**â€Š-â€ŠCompanies that need real-time data at their fingertips for their customers. Think of Uber, Amazon, Airbnb etc (**i.e. very few**). Data for these organisations ***can not*** be run and processed on a desktop machine
* **Technologies Used**â€Š-â€ŠA lot of them! Resources are needed that are unicorns, experienced and expensive. You will need an experienced Full Stack Engineer who has experience working in Data. 
* **Cost**â€Š-â€ŠAstronomical to build and not sustainable for small and medium businesses to run from both a resource and cloud cost perspective

### Solution 2â€Š-â€ŠBuilt for for speed of Analytics with lower volumes of data

This is a simple and elegant solution that consists of 3 items:

1. Cloud-based data pipeline orchestration tool
2. Data Storage solution
3. Data Reporting and Access Solution

* **Who needs this?**â€Š-â€ŠMajority of small and medium sized companies. Where time to an answer can make a huge impact on the companies growth. This is the optimum solution for any company where their data can exist on a desktop machine
* **Technologies Used** - SQL, Python and a cloud orchestration tool. Experience of these tools is commonly found with many Data Analysts or Data Engineers. 
* **Cost**â€Š-â€ŠAffordable and easy to run

## Which Solution do I need?

When deciding the solution that is needed, you need one that matches the ***current*** size and volumes of your business. It is not a good idea to go for Solution 1, prior to using Solution 2. Solution 2 will let you understand and see first hand how data can fuel your organisations decision making.

> I have seen solution 1 used  many times at a startup which has caused challenges in using data to drive decision making.

If your business strategy isn't dependent on real-time data to make business decisions then ***Solution 2*** is most likely the right answer.
