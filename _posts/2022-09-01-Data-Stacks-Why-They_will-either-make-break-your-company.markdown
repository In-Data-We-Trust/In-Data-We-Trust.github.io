Having worked in a range of companies from 20-person startups to large enterprises,  I want to share my findings about data sacks. Having used a range of them, they will either make your company flourish or make your company fail.

## How can I help you on your data journey?

I have worked with data stacks that fuel organisations growth :rocket: and others that grind it to a halt :what emoji to use?

There are some tell-tale signs that the current setup of tools or teams isn't working for your organisation. If any of the below sounds familiar, then you could have a stack that isn't helping you:

* The time to engineer data from a simple source is long and complicated
* Data is engineered, the task is marked as complete and people do not have access to the data
* There are continuous issues with the stability of the data stack, errors, failed pipelines that are not resolved

If any of the above sound familiar within your organisation, read on as I begin to break this down further.
<!-- not sure on above. Let's tweak it as we go on. -->

<!-- I started my career as a Management Consultant and then moved to become a hands-on data driven individual where I have experience of working across the full spectrum of Data. From engineering pipelines, designing and modelling data warehouses and building organisational wide analytics

From my experience of working as a full stack data individual, I have learnt one key lesson. **Business Value should remain the *why* of any decision** when designing or building any data solution.

I want to provide companies a framework to use when thinking of the *why* or *so what* for any development or platform building data related. -->

At it's core an effective data solution provides information into the hands of people ***quickly*** to make decisions. The more complicated the data stack, the longer the time is to provide any information. Which is why simplicity is key for data solutions to provide real ***Business Value***.

This is the most important item to remember for an organisation still early and trying to establish themselves as a profitable business.

> Why do you need an over complicated solution when the companies database can operate on a desktop computer? 

<!-- Trust me, you do not want your huge cost to be used to provide resources a great learning opportunity and not much value to your organisation! -->

I have seen solutions built multiple times with complex architecture that was not needed  in relation to the organisations size and maturity. When this happens, design overkill has occurred and the original purpose was long forgotten.

## What Solution Should You Use?

Over my career I have seen two types of data solutions. 


<!-- This is a difficult and challenging item to identify when reviewing documentation and ways of working. However in my career I have seen some tell-tale signs that point to the data solution being not focused on ***Business Value*** and being academic:

* The time to engineer data is long and complicated
* Data is engineered, the task is marked as complete and people do not have access to the data
* There are continuous issues with the stability of the data stack, errors, failed pipelines that are not resolved

***If any of the above sound like issues your company is facing, read the rest of this article could transform your company and how it uses data!*** -->

## Types of Solutions and which one is needed?

Over my career I have seen two types of data solutions…

### Solution 1 - Built for scale where scale is needed

Data Stack that is built to scale to be able to meet the demands of any volumes with real-time data availability. It uses the best in class technologies with the latest tools

* Who needs this? - Companies that need real-time data at their fingertips for their customers. Think of Uber, Amazon, Airbnb etc (**i.e. very few**). Data for these organisations data ***can not*** be run on a desktop machine.
* Technologies used - A lot of them! Resources are needed that are unicorns, experienced and not cost effective
* Cost - Astronomical to build and not sustainable for small and medium businesses from both a resource and cloud cost perspective

### Solution 2 - Built for for speed of insights with lower volumes of data

This is the most simple and elegant solutions that consist of 3 simple items:

1. Cloud-based data pipeline orchestration tool
2. Data Storage solution
3. Data Reporting and Access Solution

* Who needs this? - Majority of small and medium sized companies. Where time to an answer can make a huge impact on the companies growth. This is the optimum solution for any company where their data can exist on a desktop machine
* Technologies Required: SQL, Python and a cloud orchestration tool
* Cost - Affordable and easy to run 

## Which Solution do I need?

When deciding the solution that is needed, you need one that matches the ***current*** size and volumes of the company. It is not a good idea to go for Solution 1, without using Solution 2 to first understand how data can fuel your organisations decision making.

> I have seen solution 1 used far too many times at a startup which has caused challenges in the future.

If your business strategy isn't dependent on real-time data to make business decisions then Solution 2 is most likely the right answer.
